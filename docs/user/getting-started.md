# Getting Started

The following is an opinionated way of getting started with Flight Control on a local Kind cluster. Please refer to [Installing the Flight Control Service](installing-service.md) and [Installing the Flight Control CLI](installing-cli.md) for the full documentation including other installation options.

## Deploying a Local Kind Cluster

Install the following prerequisites by following the respective documentation:

* `kind` latest version ([installation guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/))
* `kubectl` CLI of a matching version ([installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/))
* `helm` CLI version v3.15 or later ([installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/))

Deploy a Kind cluster:

```console
$ kind create cluster

enabling experimental podman provider
Creating cluster "kind" ...
[...]
```

Verify the cluster is up and you can access it:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -A

NAMESPACE            NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system          coredns-76f75df574-v6plv                     1/1     Running   0          49s
kube-system          coredns-76f75df574-xfm2w                     1/1     Running   0          49s
kube-system          etcd-kind-control-plane                      1/1     Running   0          61s
kube-system          kindnet-kznkx                                1/1     Running   0          49s
kube-system          kube-apiserver-kind-control-plane            1/1     Running   0          61s
kube-system          kube-controller-manager-kind-control-plane   1/1     Running   0          61s
kube-system          kube-proxy-qffqj                             1/1     Running   0          49s
kube-system          kube-scheduler-kind-control-plane            1/1     Running   0          65s
local-path-storage   local-path-provisioner-7577fdbbfb-wxbck      1/1     Running   0          49s
```

Verify Helm is installed and can access the cluster:

```console
$ helm list

NAME  NAMESPACE  REVISION  UPDATED  STATUS  CHART  APP VERSION
```

## Deploying the Flight Control Service

### Standalone Flight Control on k8s/KIND

Start your k8s/KIND cluster. For KIND cluster you can use [example config](../../deploy/kind.yaml).

```console
$ kind create cluster --config kind.yaml

[...]
```

Install a released version of the Flight Control Service into the cluster by running:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install --version=<version-to-install> \
    --namespace flightctl --create-namespace \
    flightctl oci://quay.io/flightctl/charts/flightctl \
    --set global.baseDomain=${YOUR_IP}.nip.io \
    --set global.exposeServicesMethod=nodePort

```

Optionally, you may change the deployed UI version adding `--set ui.image.tag=<ui-version-to-install>`.
Available versions can be found in [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/flightctl/charts/flightctl-ui?tab=tags)

### Flight Control on OpenShift

#### Standalone Flight Control with built-in Keycloak

Install a released version of the Flight Control Service into the cluster by running:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install --version=<version-to-install> \
    --namespace flightctl --create-namespace \
    flightctl oci://quay.io/flightctl/charts/flightctl

```

Verify your Flight Control Service is up and running:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n flightctl

[...]
```

#### Standalone Flight Control with external OIDC

Create a values.yaml file with the following content

```yaml
global:
  auth:
    type: oidc
    oidcAuthority: https://oidc/realms/your_realm 
    internalOidcAuthority: https://internal.oidc/realms/your_realm

```

Install a released version of the Flight Control Service into the cluster by running:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install --version=<version-to-install> \
    --namespace flightctl --create-namespace \
    flightctl oci://quay.io/flightctl/charts/flightctl \
    --values values.yaml

```

Verify your Flight Control Service is up and running:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n flightctl

[...]
```

#### Flight Control in ACM

Install a released version of the Flight Control Service into the cluster by running:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install --version=<version-to-install> \
    --namespace flightctl --create-namespace \
    flightctl oci://quay.io/flightctl/charts/flightctl \
    --set global.target=acm

```

Optionally, you may change the deployed UI version adding `--set ui.image.tag=<ui-version-to-install>`.
Available versions can be found in [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/flightctl/charts/flightctl-ocp-ui?tab=tags)
Verify your Flight Control Service is up and running:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n flightctl

[...]
```

After deploying the Flight Control ACM UI plugin, it needs to be manually enabled. Open your OpenShift Console -> Home -> Overview -> Status card -> Dynamic plugins and enable the Flight Control ACM UI plugin.
After enabling the plugin, you will need to wait for the Console operator to rollout a new deployment.

## Installing the Flight Control CLI

In a terminal, select the appropriate Flight Control CLI binary for your OS (linux or darwin) and CPU architecture (amd64 or arm64), for example:

```console
$ FC_CLI_BINARY=flightctl-linux-amd64

[...]
```

Download the `flightctl` binary to your machine:

```console
$ curl -LO https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl/releases/download/latest/${FC_CLI_BINARY}

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
100 29.9M  100 29.9M    0     0  5965k      0  0:00:05  0:00:05 --:--:-- 7341k
```

Verify the downloaded binary has the correct checksum:

```console
$ echo "$(curl -L -s https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl/releases/download/latest/${FC_CLI_BINARY}-sha256.txt)  ${FC_CLI_BINARY}" | shasum --check

flightctl-linux-amd64: OK
```

If the checksum is correct, rename it to `flightctl` and make it executable:

```console
$ mv "${FC_CLI_BINARY}" flightctl && chmod +x flightctl

[...]
```

Finally, move it into a location within your shell's search path.

## Logging into the Flight Control Service from the CLI

### Standalone deployment

Retrieve the password for the "demouser" account that's been automatically generated for you during installation:

```console
$ kubectl get secret/keycloak-demouser-secret -n flightctl -o=jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d

[...]
```

Use the CLI to log into the Flight Control Service:

```console
$ flightctl login https://api.flightctl.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ --web --insecure-skip-tls-verify

[...]
```

In the web browser that opens, use the login "demouser" and the password you retrieved in the previous step.

Verify you can now access the service via the CLI:

```console
$ flightctl get devices

NAME                                                  OWNER   SYSTEM  UPDATED     APPLICATIONS  LAST SEEN
```

### ACM deployment

Use the CLI to log into the Flight Control Service:

```console
$ flightctl login https://api.flightctl.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ --web --insecure-skip-tls-verify

[...]
```

In the web browser that opens, use your ACM login credentials.

Verify you can now access the service via the CLI:

```console
$ flightctl get devices

NAME                                                  OWNER   SYSTEM  UPDATED     APPLICATIONS  LAST SEEN
```

## Login into the Flight Control Service from the standalone UI

Browse to `ui.flightctl.MY.DOMAIN` and use the login "demouser" and the password you retrieved in the previous step.

## Building a Bootable Container Image including the Flight Control Agent

Next, we will use [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) to build a [bootable container image (bootc)](https://containers.github.io/bootc/) that includes the Flight Control Agent binary and configuration. The configuration contains the connection details and credentials required by the agent to discover the service and send an enrollment request to the service. After deploying the flightctl server, this configuration can be retrieved after a Certificate Signing Request has been completed as outlined in the steps below.

### Create Certificate Signing Request configuration

For enrollment, the device will need an enrollment certificate to be present. The enrollment certificate is created when a certificate signing request in flightctl is approved by an authorized user and can be retrieved once this process is complete. The four steps below describe this process.

#### 1/4 Create the signed CSR

This CSR will be embedded in the CSR resource configuration file that will be applied to flightctl.

Create a certificate signing request `.csr` file with openssl:

```console
openssl req -new -sha256 -key myeckey.pem -out mycsr.csr
```

**NOTES**:

1. The signing key passed with `-key` MUST be an ECDSA key. To generate an ECDSA key, use `openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -noout -out myeckey.pem` or see the [openssl documentation on ECDSA](https://docs.openssl.org/1.0.2/man1/ecparam/#synopsis) for more options.
2. The Subject Common Name in the CSR MUST be either blank or at least 16 characters in length.

For more options, including generating a new private key to sign the CSR, see [openssl's documentation](https://docs.openssl.org/master/man1/openssl-req/#options).

#### 2/4 Create the CSR resource configuration file

You can create a CSR resource configuration file wrapping the CSR file above either by generating it with flightctl or manually. Each option is described below. You may choose the CSR name, and desired expiration in seconds.

##### Option 1: Generate the CSR config file

Issue the command below, specifying your `.csr` file and an output file, and optionally specifying the CSR name and expiration in seconds. The CSR name defaults to `mycsr`, the expiration to 604800 seconds. The `-y` flag enables overwriting the output file if it already exists.

```console
flightctl csr-generate mycsr.csr -e 604800 -n chosenname -o myoutputfile -y
```

##### Option 2: Manually create the CSR config file

The file name, `metadata.name`, and `spec.expirationSeconds` can vary. The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `spec.signerName`, and `spec.usages` must match those below. The `spec.request` field will hold a base64-encoded contents of the `.csr` file previously created.

```console
$ cat > mycsrresource.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: mycsr
spec:
  request: <add base64-encoded CSR>
  signerName: enrollment
  usages: ["clientAuth", "CA:false"]
  expirationSeconds: 604800
EOF
```

Add the base64-encoded contents of the previously created CSR to the field `spec.request`, making sure to remove newlines. This can be generated with:

```console
cat mycsr.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n'
```

The end result should be structured the same way as [`examples/csr.yaml`](/examples/csr.yaml).

#### 3/4 Create the CSR resource in flightctl

You may then create the CSR resource by running the command below:

```console
$ flightctl apply -f mycsrresource.yaml
certificatesigningrequest: applying mycsrresource.yaml/mycsr: 201 Created
```

You can view the status of the certificate signing request with:

```console
$ flightctl get csr/mycsr
NAME    AGE     SIGNERNAME  USERNAME    REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
mycsr   2m29s   ca          <none>      10m0s               Pending

```

#### 4/4 Approve the CSR

The certificate signing request will need to be approved. As an authorized user, you may approve a specific certificate signing request by running (replace `mycsr` with the name of your CSR):

```console
flightctl approve csr/mycsr
```

The Condition of the certificate signing request will then show:

```console
$ flightctl get csr/mycsr
NAME    AGE     SIGNERNAME  USERNAME    REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
mycsr   3m4s    enrollment  <none>      10m0s               Approved

```

### Retrieve and use the agent config file

Once the CSR has been approved, retrieve the agent configuration with enrollment credentials by running:

```console
flightctl enrollmentconfig <mycsr> --private-key <myeckey.pem> > agentconfig.yaml
```

Make sure to supply the same name that you entered in your original CSR configuration resource `.yaml` file, and the same private key you used when generating the CSR.

The returned output should look similar to this:

```console
$ cat agentconfig.yaml

enrollment-service:
  authentication:
    client-certificate-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBD...
    client-key-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBF...
  enrollment-ui-endpoint: https://ui.flightctl.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080
  service:
    certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBD...
    server: https://agent-api.flightctl.127.0.0.1.nip.io:7443
  grpc-management-endpoint: grpcs://agent-grpc.127.0.0.1.nip.io:7444
```

Create a `Containerfile` with the following content:

```console
$ cat Containerfile

FROM quay.io/centos-bootc/centos-bootc:stream9

RUN dnf -y copr enable @redhat-et/flightctl-dev centos-stream-9-x86_64 && \
    dnf -y install flightctl-agent; \
    dnf -y clean all; \
    systemctl enable flightctl-agent.service

ADD agentconfig.yaml /etc/flightctl/config.yaml
```

Note this is a regular `Containerfile` that you're used to from Docker/Podman, with the difference that the base image referenced in the `FROM` directive is bootable. This means you can use standard container build tools and workflows.

For example, as a user of Quay who has the privileges to push images into the `quay.io/${YOUR_QUAY_ORG}/centos-bootc-flightctl` repository, build the bootc image like this:

```console
$ sudo podman build -t quay.io/${YOUR_QUAY_ORG}/centos-bootc-flightctl:v1

[...]
```

Log in to your Quay account:

```console
$ sudo podman login quay.io

Username: ******
Password: ******
Login Succeeded!
```

Push your bootc image to Quay:

```console
$ sudo podman push quay.io/${YOUR_QUAY_ORG}/centos-bootc-flightctl:v1

[...]
```

## Provisioning a Device with a Bootable Container Image

A bootc image is a file system image, i.e. it contains the files to be written into an existing file system, but not the disk layout and the file system itself. To provision a device, you need to generate a full disk image containing the bootc image.

Use the [`bootc-image-builder`](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) tool to generate that disk image as follows:

```console
$ mkdir -p output && \
  sudo podman run --rm -it --privileged --pull=newer --security-opt label=type:unconfined_t \
    -v $(pwd)/output:/output -v /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
    quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder:latest \
    --type raw quay.io/${YOUR_QUAY_ORG}/centos-bootc-flightctl:v1

[...]
```

Once `bootc-image-builder` completes, you'll find the raw disk image under `output/image/disk.raw`. Now you can flash this image to a device using standard tools like [arm-image-installer](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/iot/physical-device-setup/#_scripted_image_transfer_with_arm_image_installer), [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), or [`dd`](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/iot/physical-device-setup/#_manual_image_transfer_with_dd).

For other image types like QCoW2 or VMDK or ways to install via USB stick or network, see [Building Images](building-images.md).

## Enrolling a Device

When the Flight Control Agent first starts, it sends an enrollment request to the Flight Control Service. You can see the list of requests pending approval with:

```console
$ flightctl get enrollmentrequests

NAME                                                  APPROVAL  APPROVER  APPROVED LABELS
54shovu028bvj6stkovjcvovjgo0r48618khdd5huhdjfn6raskg  Pending   <none>    <none>    
```

You can approve an enrollment request and optionally add labels to the device:

```console
$ flightctl approve -l region=eu-west-1 -l site=factory-berlin er/54shovu028bvj6stkovjcvovjgo0r48618khdd5huhdjfn6raskg

Success.

$ flightctl get enrollmentrequests

NAME                                                  APPROVAL  APPROVER  APPROVED LABELS
54shovu028bvj6stkovjcvovjgo0r48618khdd5huhdjfn6raskg  Approved  demouser  region=eu-west-1,site=factory-berlin
```

After the enrollment completes, you can find the device in the list of devices:

```console
$ flightctl get devices

NAME                                                  OWNER   SYSTEM  UPDATED     APPLICATIONS  LAST SEEN
54shovu028bvj6stkovjcvovjgo0r48618khdd5huhdjfn6raskg  <none>  Online  Up-to-date  <none>        3 seconds ago
```

## Where to go from here

Now that you have a Flight Control-managed device, refer to [Managing Devices](managing-devices.yaml) and [Managing Fleets](managing-fleets.yaml) for how to configure and update individual or fleets of devices.
