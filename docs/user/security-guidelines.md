## Overview

Flight Control is a device management platform that provides secure enrollment, configuration management, and monitoring of edge devices. The system uses hardware root-of-trust, mutual TLS authentication, and certificate-based identity management to ensure secure device operations.

### Security Architecture

Flight Control implements a multi-layered security approach:

- **Hardware Root-of-Trust**: TPM-based device identity and attestation
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: X.509 certificates for all communications
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: Bidirectional certificate verification
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for users and devices
- **Encrypted Communications**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

Flight Control supports multiple authentication providers:

#### Kubernetes Authentication

- **Type**: `k8s`
- **Description**: Uses Kubernetes service account tokens for authentication

```yaml
auth:
  type: k8s
  k8s:
    serviceAccountToken: "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token"
```

#### OIDC Authentication

- **Type**: `oidc`
- **Description**: OpenID Connect authentication with external providers

```yaml
auth:
  type: oidc
  oidc:
    issuerURL: "https://your-oidc-provider.com"
    clientID: "flightctl-client"
    clientSecret: "your-client-secret"
```

#### AAP (Ansible Automation Platform) Authentication

- **Type**: `aap`
- **Description**: Integration with Ansible Automation Platform

```yaml
auth:
  type: aap
  aap:
    serverURL: "https://your-aap-server.com"
    username: "your-username"
    password: "your-password"
```

### Device Authentication

Devices authenticate using X.509 client certificates:

#### Enrollment Process

1. **Hardware Identity**: Device generates cryptographic key pair using TPM
2. **Certificate Signing Request**: Device submits CSR with hardware fingerprint
3. **Manual Approval**: Administrator approves enrollment request
4. **Certificate Issuance**: Service issues device-specific management certificate
5. **Secure Communication**: Device uses management certificate for all subsequent communications

#### Certificate Management

- **Enrollment Certificates**: Used only for initial enrollment (configurable validity)
- **Management Certificates**: Device-specific certificates for ongoing operations
- **Hardware Protection**: Private keys are protected by TPM when available
- **Automatic Rotation**: Certificates are currently *NOT* rotated

### Authorization

#### User Permissions

Flight Control implements role-based access control:

- **Device Management**: Create, read, update, delete devices
- **Fleet Management**: Manage fleets and templates
- **Enrollment Approval**: Approve or deny device enrollment requests
- **System Administration**: Access to system configuration and monitoring

#### Device Permissions

- **Self-Management**: Devices can only modify their own configuration
- **Status Reporting**: Devices can report their status and health
- **Template Application**: Devices can apply approved configuration templates

## Data Protection

### Data in Transit

All communications are encrypted using TLS 1.3:

#### API Communications

- **User API**: HTTPS with TLS 1.3, minimum version enforced
- **Agent API**: Mutual TLS with client certificate verification
- **Database Connections**: TLS encryption for PostgreSQL connections
- **Redis Communications**: TLS encryption for key-value store

#### Certificate Configuration

```yaml
# Server certificate configuration
service:
  srvCertFile: "/path/to/server.crt"
  srvKeyFile: "/path/to/server.key"
  altNames: ["flightctl.example.com", "localhost"]

# Client certificate configuration
auth:
  clientCertificate: "/path/to/client.crt"
  clientKey: "/path/to/client.key"
```

### Data at Rest

#### Database Encryption

- **PostgreSQL**: Supports full database encryption, but this is *NOT* enabled by default
- **Connection Encryption**: TLS for all database connections
- **Credential Storage**: Database credentials are stored in plain text or base64 encoding (*NOT* encrypted) - in Kubernetes Secrets when deployed on k8s, and in Podman secrets when deployed with quadlets

#### File System Security

- **Certificate Storage**: Certificates stored with 0600 permissions
- **Configuration Files**: Configuration files stored with 0600 permissions
- **Log Files**: Log files stored with appropriate permissions

### Data Privacy

#### Data Collection

Flight Control collects the following data:

- **Device Information**: Hardware specifications, operating system details
- **System Status**: Health metrics, application status, resource usage
- **Configuration**: Applied configuration templates and settings
- **Events**: User actions, system events, security events

#### Data Retention

- **Event Logs**: Configurable retention period (default: 7 days)
- **Device Status**: Retained for device lifecycle

#### Data Access Controls

- **Organization Isolation**: Data is isolated by organization
- **Role-Based Access**: Users can only access authorized data

## Network Security

Flight Control requires specific network ports and firewall configuration. For detailed network requirements, see [Network Requirements](network-requirements.md).

### Rate Limiting

Flight Control implements IP-based rate limiting to protect against abuse and ensure fair usage. Proper configuration is essential for security, especially when using reverse proxies.

#### Rate Limiting Security

- **IP-Based Protection**: Rate limiting is applied per client IP address
- **Proxy Header Support**: Automatically handles X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, and True-Client-IP headers
- **Separate Auth Limits**: Stricter rate limits for authentication endpoints
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable limits for different environments

#### Security Considerations

1. **Reverse Proxy Configuration**: When using reverse proxies, ensure they're configured to send real client IPs
2. **Trusted Proxies**: Only allow trusted reverse proxies to set IP headers
3. **Network Isolation**: Restrict direct access to the Flight Control API
4. **Monitor Abuse**: Watch for unusual rate limiting patterns

For detailed rate limiting configuration and reverse proxy setup, see [Rate Limiting](rate-limiting.md).

### Service Endpoints

- **User API**: Port 3443 (HTTPS)
- **Agent API**: Port 7443 (mTLS)
