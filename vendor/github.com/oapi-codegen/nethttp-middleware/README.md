# `net/http` Middleware

⚠️ This README may be for the latest development version, which may contain unreleased changes. Please ensure you're looking at the README for the latest release version.

Middleware for servers that implement `net/http` handlers, for use with [deepmap/oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen), which has been tested to work with:

- [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
- [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)

But if you're using something that's compliant with `net/http` it should work as-is.
