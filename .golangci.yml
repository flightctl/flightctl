  # Which dirs to exclude: issues from them won't be reported.
  # Can use regexp here: `generated.*`, regexp is applied on full path,
  # including the path prefix if one is set.
  # Default dirs are skipped independently of this option's value (see exclude-dirs-use-default).
  # "/" will be replaced by current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows.
