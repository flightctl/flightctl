Thank you for installing Keycloak.

You can access the Keycloak UI at https://auth.{{ include "flightctl.getBaseDomain" . }}/realms/flightctl/account

A demo user "demouser" has been created for you. You can retrieve its password by running:

    kubectl get secret -n {{ .Release.namespace }} keycloak-demouser-secret -o=jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
