COMMENT_1_RESPONSE:
I've updated the error handling for ambiguous "unauthorized" errors encountered when pulling container images. The error message is now more descriptive, explicitly mentioning that the issue could be due to invalid credentials or a non-existent image path, which directly addresses the reviewer's concern about the ambiguity of these errors.
