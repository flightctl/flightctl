Flight Control Contributor Policy

Welcome!
Thank you for considering a contribution to Flight Control. We appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve this project. This document explains how to contribute effectively and responsibly, following CNCF Best Practices and the Contributor Covenant v2.1 to maintain a welcoming, open source community.
1. Before You Get Started

    GitHub Account

        You’ll need a GitHub account with a verified email address.
        - How to verify: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/email-visibility/about-email-verification

    Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

        All commits must be “signed off” using the -s flag to confirm you agree with the DCO.

        git commit -s -m "Add new feature"

        This ensures you have the right to submit the code and that you agree to release it under the project’s open source license.

    Code of Conduct

        By participating, you agree to uphold our Code of Conduct.

        If you experience or witness any violations, contact [conduct@flightcontrol.io] (replace with a real address).

2. What Can I Contribute?

Flight Control welcomes all contributions:

    Code: New features, bug fixes, performance improvements

    Documentation: Tutorials, API references, FAQs

    Tests & CI: Unit tests, integration tests, pipelines

    Design & UX: Visual assets, user flows, wireframes

    Community: Issue triage, Q&A, helping other contributors

    Tip: We label beginner-friendly issues with “good first issue” to help newcomers get started.

3. Contribution Process

    Fork & Clone

        Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone it locally.

        Example:

    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/flightctl.git
    cd flightctl

Create a Branch

    Name it descriptively, e.g., feature/add-new-thing or fix/docs-typo.

    git checkout -b feature/add-new-thing

Make & Test Changes

    Implement your idea or fix, and add/maintain tests as needed.

    Ensure you follow coding standards (see Coding Style).

Commit with DCO Sign-off

    Commit each change with the -s flag:

    git commit -s -m "Brief summary of change"

Push & Open Pull Request

    Push your branch:

        git push origin feature/add-new-thing

        Open a Pull Request (PR) against the main branch in the main repository.

        Provide a clear description of what you changed, why you changed it, and any testing done.

    Code Review

        A project maintainer will review your PR.

        They may request changes or clarifications.

        Please be patient; maintainers are here to help.

    Merge

        Once approved and all checks pass (CI, reviews, etc.), the PR can be merged.

4. Code & Style Guidelines

    Readability: Write clear, maintainable code.

    Testing: Update or add tests if your changes affect functionality.

    Commit Messages: Use short, descriptive messages.

    Documentation: Update relevant docs (including README) if your changes introduce new concepts or features.

    Linting & Formatting: Follow any project-specific lint or format rules (if configured).

    Note: We’ll publish a more detailed “Coding Style Guide” soon.

5. Licensing & Legal

    Open Source License

        By contributing, you agree to license your work under the same terms as this project’s primary license (see LICENSE file).

    DCO Compliance

        Each commit must be signed off (git commit -s).

        This ensures you accept the Developer Certificate of Origin.

    No CLA Needed (for now)

        We do not currently use a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

        If that changes, we’ll notify contributors.

6. Code of Conduct

We adhere to the Contributor Covenant v2.1.
By taking part, you agree to treat others with respect and kindness.

    Enforcement:

        If you spot or experience any misconduct, please reach out confidentially at [xxx].

        Our maintainers will review and address each case promptly and fairly.

7. Contributor Recognition

We love celebrating contributions! We will recognize contributors in:

    A CONTRIBUTORS.txt (or .md) file in the repo

    Release notes for significant features or fixes

    The official project website (under development)

8. CNCF Alignment

This project aims to uphold the CNCF’s Open Source Best Practices:

    Transparent Governance: Public decisions, open meeting invites.

    Inclusive Communication: Slack, forums, or mailing lists for open discussion.

    Onboarding Support: “Good first issue” tags, clear docs, friendly reviews.

    Legal Clarity: Signed DCO, OSI-approved license.

9. Questions & Support

    GitHub Discussions: (Once available) Post your questions or ideas.

    Slack or Chat: (Future workspace link) Join our real-time conversation channel.

    Issues: If you find a bug or need a feature, open a GitHub issue.
